Listening state by state.

You can tell a lot about a state by typing it's name into Spotify and counting how many results before getting football related content and/or the state university marching band. 

Why does Ohio have so much good songs? Musicality of the indian name

Where does that name come from?

Who were the indians in the Ohio River Valley?

Descending on clouds of heavenly harp music.

Is this a mean song?
