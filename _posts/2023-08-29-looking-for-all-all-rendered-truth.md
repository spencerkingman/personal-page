## A - Sounds

Lonnie is looking for all encompassing truths to manifest in the art works that emerge, somehow, from within. Because the song is improvised, we get to experience the song as a documentary of the very thing he is narrating.

## B - Notes

fit into a broader context (album, artist, genre, etc.)

## C - Memories

I remember driving around playing this song on repeat, trying to learn how to sing it. There's only one chord, but the improvised melody is difficult to pin down. It is fun to try to lock into Holley's rhythm.

Hannah gave me this album as a gift.
