These songs, more meaningful to me than others, send my mind off in many directions. I have many thoughts about the songs themselves--the construction, the lyrics, the performances. But they also sit within my mind as totems of all the other things I think about. They give shape and coherence to my life story. They invite me to remember things I might otherwise neglect. I have used them to travel the world.

I find it so satisfying to listen to them, and think on the words they put down in the way of my thoughts. It seemed obvious to try writing them down. My plan is to choose songs at random from the playlist of my favorites and use it as a vehicle for writing about both the songs and myself. I don't know how readable it will be, or how far I will take it, but that is the plan.
