Radiohead was my favorite band when I was a young adult.
There was WOW, where my sister and I would drive and sit and read from the wall of rock magazines, many of them British.

in 1997, when I was a depressed and lonely 17 year old, I bought OK Computer right after it was released, because I had read some buzz on it. I was so hooked in by it, that I remember I stayed up all night, listening to it over and over, even though it was a school night.

On The Ground, anti war group at Columbia College.

A good chunk of the songs I have written have been about trying to apprehend war from the point of view of the people experiencing it from the ground. Scatterbrain is a song that I wish I had written. Perhaps it had similar goals.

Ther are two meanings that stick out for me. One is the description of a warzone. The literal reality of having one's brains scattered.

The other is partly the feeling of living in the internet age, and the information overload that makes it impossible to think and feel grounded. "Everyone, everything, all of the time" as it is described in _Idioteque_.
