Utopian theme. I am drawn to it, and I am shocked that there are so few Utopian songs in the vein of say "Imagine" by John Lennon.

Kim Stanley Robinson

The narrator moves between the future and past tenses in a way that is unsettling.

What is the posture of this song towards the future it calls forth?

I think it is clear that Nina Simone is yearning for this new world, but there is something desperate about the performance too. Like she is trying to will something into existence.
