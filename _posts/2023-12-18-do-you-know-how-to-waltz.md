I saw Low at least twice. Once, they were playing at the Metro in Chicago, after "Things We Lost in the Fire". It is a fairly big venue, but the guitar player played out of the smallest fender amp. It was probably a 1x8".

The second time was after "Double Negative" came out. It was at the Funhouse at Mr. Small's in Pittsburgh. That is just a small bar venue. I was at the very front.

It doesn't sound to me like Low had to work that hard to put this song together. They hit on a combination of tempo, chords, and delay that produced something special. They allowed themselves to be taken away by these sounds, for 14 minutes on the recording, but in a larger sense, throughout their career and lives as a band. It impels you to surrender, not to virtuosic playing, but with the players to a weight of sound.
