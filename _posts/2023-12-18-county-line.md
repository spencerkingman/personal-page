## A

I hear a round keyboard. I hear a slow tempo. I hear the drums taking the lead. I hear slow vibrato in the vocal.

## B

I love the tempo of this song. McCombs has a talent for dialing down the metronome slightly lower than what you would expect, to great affect.

## C

I have a strange connection to Cass McCombs. He was married to an ex-girlfriend of mine. This makes it somewhat easy to fall into memories of her and of our time together when I listen to his music.

Katie Urcioli relationship

Why did...
