Delicate handling by all players. 

What is this song about? I have a lot of freedom to free associate. I looked up a trnaslation of the lyrics once. They gave me a vague idea of the songs themes, but I regret doing that. I enjoyed the complete abstraction that I had with possessing no knowledge of Arabic. 

The lo-fi actually is preferable in a track like this, because it communicates to me that this is a live recording, with the percussion, orchestra, chorus, all playing at a distance from the mic. 

Oum Khoultom recordings the audience is so live. That enthusiasm is infectious, even though the music is quite foreign to me. I'm glad that this recording doesn't have that feature because I find it to be so intimate.
