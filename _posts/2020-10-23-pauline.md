When I fantasize about what I would buy if money was no issue, one thing I imagine a house full of instruments. The fantasy is more about the variety than the quality. Anything very expensive or rare and I would be reticent to pick it up. I also lack the collector's impulse to accumulate many variations of the same thing. I've never felt the need for  more than 1 electric guitar or enjoyed losing myself in the vagaries of "gear." However, I would be quite happy to have at my disposal the ingredients of any high school band or orchestra, a piano, a drumkit, rock band stuff, some DJ equipment, a gamelan orchestra (just joking).

I've had enough exposure to the different types of instruments that I feel like I can wrestle a sound out of any of them. They are extremely curious objects, and it is deeply satisfying to find one's way into their physics. It can be quite startling when you crack the code and unleash a sound. This naive hacking is maybe as enjoyable to me as any "shredding" I have been able to manage on the instruments I know best.  

One instrument that I've always wanted but never had, or even played, is the pedal steel guitar. I think it is definitely underappreciated and underexplored, maybe because it is so strongly associated with old-fashioned country music. Some of those great songs, like "Don't Come Home A-Drinkin (With Lovin' On Your Mind)" or 'Buck Owens' "Above and Beyond", show off it's lively and nimble side. Hank William's From It has capabilities that no other 
 It sings. Like an er-hu

 That, of course, is silly, because I'm an adult. I have a job and a house and a car. I could get myself "Hey Nico, Dieu de la guitarre"
