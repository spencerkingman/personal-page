I was recently asked to make a playlist of my favorite songs, something that could be shared and used to promote my own music. I was told to put together around 20 songs, with at least a few somewhat-popular artists. Within a few days, I had many hours of songs. They came to mind quite easily, as if I already had been making this list unconsciously over the years. Honestly, one of my most consistent and basic desires is that people will simply ask me to talk about music. I don't know if I should take it as a bad sign that almost noone ever does. 

These songs, more meaningful to me than others, send my mind off in many directions. I have many thoughts about the songs themselves--the construction, the lyrics, the performances. But they also sit within my mind as totems of so many other things. They give shape and coherence to my life story. They invite me to remember things I might otherwise neglect. I have used them to travel the world.

I find it so satisfying to listen to them, and think on the words they put down in the way of my thoughts. It seems obvious to try writing them down. My plan is to choose songs at random from the playlist of my favorites and use it as a vehicle for writing about both the songs and myself. I don't know how readable it will be, or how far I will take it, but that is the plan.
