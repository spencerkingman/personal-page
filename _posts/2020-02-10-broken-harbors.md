In the fall of 2010, while Hannah was in her 7th month of pregnancy with our first daughter, Nat Baldwin offered me a chance to play a showcase-type concert at a club in Brooklyn where he had a short residence (Zebulon, I think). I had played with Nat in Dirty Projectors for about half a year, but we also had some shared experiences prior to that, playing with Viking Moses and Deer Tick. Not only would he be on the bill, but also one of my favorite singers, Diane Cluck. 

This was a hugely exciting prospect for me, but there was a small wrinkle. The show was on a weeknight, and I had just begun my first teaching job, the first weeks of "my career." If I had been working at a public school district, there would be a pool of substitute teachers and a contractually normal way of requesting time off. But I had landed at an orthodox Jewish day school. Days off were discouraged because the Jewish holidays were already turning the calendar to Swiss cheese. The staff was small, and we were asked to find our own subsitutes, calling from a list of ladies in the community.  The rabbis were not prudish about _goyishe_ matters, but I, as a neophyte, was sheepish about telling them that I needed the day off to rush off to New York City and play strange music in a night club.
