Sometime in the spring(?) of 2005, I played in a small club in Manhattan that looked like a train car. I was just playing my guitar. I was wearing a blue stretchy hooded shirt with funny pockets in the back. I thought it was perhaps for speed skating (In retrospect, I think it was for cyclists). I was able to fit CDs in the pockets, and at one point in my performance, I talked about the shirt and did a flashy (for me) reveal of my CD's for sale by spinning around and showing the pockets. I suspect this is the most aggressively I have ever tried to show of my CDs for sale during a performance.

That night, Dave Longstreth was in the audience. Dirty Projectors was at this point a quite obscure project, but I was a fan, having played "The Glad Fact" quite regularly on my University of Chicago radio show. I was quite pleased to meet him.

We maybe talked or ran into each other a few more times when he asked, "Have you ever seen _The Song Remains The Same_?". This was his way of proposing that I join a band he was putting together. _The Song Remains The Same_ is a Led Zeppelin movie (I still have never seen it) that apparently features some "unplugged" performances
