If I were the president, this is what I would do 

- Immediate Executive Actions
    - __Cancel all the student debt__. Get lots of 18-45-year-olds in your army. Federal government is the creditor on almost all of it, and this can be done by executive order with little friction. (Honestly, if I was advising Trump, I would tell him to do this now and he'd probably win. If I was advising Biden, I would tell him to promise this and _he'd_ probably win.)
    - __Immediately raise minimum wage__ for federal workers to $15. There are 2 million federal employees who make $7.25 right now. They're pay would more than double and they wouldn't be subject to layoffs or a capital strike in the same way as private sector workers. Raise minimum wage for all as part of Green New Deal push (later).
    - __Decriminalize Marijuana__ at the Federal Level via executive order + compliant Attorney General. Win allegiance of lots of non-voters/new-voters.
    - Move to quickly __demilitarize the border__, constrain ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. I believe that this much can be done without new legislation.
- Top legislative priorities
    - First: __Voting Reform; Grow the Electorate__
        - This has to come first because it opens a way for populist progressives to secure and expand power, in a way that probably won't be sabotaged (I think) by the Democratic leadership, the press, or the courts. 
        - Call it something like "Make Voting Easy Act" but sell it as the new Voting Rights Act. Consolidate support of older African-American Voters. 
            - Lock in Vote-by-mail, Early Voting, Weekend voting, multi-day voting window
            - Paper ballots; standardized accessible format
            - Some flashy anti-fraud, anti-hacking stuff
            - Prohibit gerrymandering, district boundaries set by independent data-scientists to be fair (fair districts are a win for Democrats in the long run)
            - Ranked choice voting in house, senate, and presidential elections
            - Restore the old Voting Rights provisions prohibiting discrimination
            - Compromise on Voter ID if you have to.
            - Lower the voting age to 16
            - Recruit young people to do poll/election work.
            - Criminal Justice Reform 
                - similar to what won bipartisan support in Florida. Get people out of prison, and restore their voting rights. Again win non-voters/new-voters. 
            - Save other stuff (campaign finance reform, DC statehood) for later.
    - Second: __Judicial Reform; Unblock Legislative Agenda__
        - Term limits for supreme court: 18 years
        - After 18 years, justice becomes non-ruling advisor to supreme court or serves on a lower federal court.
        - Each president gets to fill 2 vacancies per term. One in second year, one in fourth year.
        - If the senate fails to approve any nominee then the executive branch gets to choose one of the rejected nominees for a popular up-or-down vote on the next federal election ballot.
    - Third: __Medicare 4 All__
        - Need judicial reform above, so that a victorious medicare 4 all bill wouldn't be ruled unconstitional.
    - Fourth: Green New Deal
- Secondary legislative priorities. 
    - Regulate Big Tech/Rescue Journalism.
        -  
    - End high-stakes tests.
        - De-incentivize high-stakes testing in public schools. Delink federal education funding from standardized testing and adequate yearly progress, with a warning that after 2 years, funding will be withheld from states that continue to subject elementary schoolers to a "big test". Could be very popular with parents and teachers across party lines.
    - Immigration Liberalization.
- Foreign policy
    - First Steps
        - Cancel IMF/World Bank debt obligations, at least of poorest nations. Suspend debt obligations of others (say it is for COVID, but secretly with the plan to indefinitely suspend). Do this quietly. 
        - Quietly restore and expand support for the Kurds in Iraq/Syria. 
        - Quietly withdraw active support of right-wing regimes in Brazil, Bolivia, Honduras, Phillipines, Indonesia.
        - De-escalate with Iran. This is tricky, but anti-Iran policies have become associated with Trump, giving you political cover that you don't have with Cuba or Venezuela or North Korea or Russia. 
    - Second Step
        - Loudly withdraw support for War in Yemen, but beyond that, don't touch Saudi Arabia or Israel at first (those are higher stakes). Educate and lead the public; create a popular moral concensus against war profiteering, arms-trafficking, proxy war that can be mobilized eventually for more ambitious demilitarization from below.
    - Third Step
        - Initiate a Truth and Reconcilliation project for the War on Terror (focused at first on War in Iraq). This should be very public, and should force top leaders (including President Bush) to endure public scrutiny.
    - Fourth Step
    - Things that would be good, but probably impossible for now.
        - Reinstate the draft.
        - Close the CIA.
        - Dramatically shrink the military.
        - Unilaterally de-nuclearize.
