The first Snatam song I heard was "The Sun Shines on Everyone"

Hypnobabies

White Sikhs

Gurbani Kirtan

Song that seemed to have a magical effect on are daughters, making them drop to sleep even as tiny babies.

Sleeping powder, salt

Ramona began to take on the guru names in the song as a kind of personal mythology.
