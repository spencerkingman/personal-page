## A

Link Wray describes a dream...

Just exquisitely loose playing. The bass popping and burbling free through the whole song evokes bubbling hot lava, or hot-stepping over some coals. Link Wray has a great squelched electric guitar sound on the solo (also see the solo on "God Out West" from the same album).

Link Wray become's more of a madman, screaming at the end of the track, evoking Let it Bleed's "Monkey Man", but on a more serious ends.

There is something magical about playing that just hangs together because the players are relaxed. It may not always be clear what distinguishes the chemistry of loose playing from the non-chemistry of sloppy, disjointed playing?

Link Wray's Name?

Native American player. I was trying to look up players

## D

Famously, the inventor of the barre chord. But I always thought that is a stupid title. Surely others have played barre chords. There's only 6 strings and there's only 5 fingers on your hand. You have to stretch and contort your hand to finger any chords on a guitar. When it comes to fingers, you have to do a lot with a little.
